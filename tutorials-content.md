## Tutorial 3: Building a RAG Solution with SAP BTP

**Difficulty**: Intermediate | **Duration**: 45 minutes

### Overview
Create a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) solution that combines your business data with LLM capabilities to provide contextual, accurate answers.

### What You'll Learn
- Understanding RAG architecture
- Setting up a document repository
- Integrating SAP Document AI for extraction
- Querying with business context

### Architecture Overview
A RAG system has three main components:
1. **Document Store**: Your business documents (PDFs, Word files, etc.)
2. **Embedding Service**: Converts documents into numerical vectors for similarity search
3. **LLM**: Generates answers based on retrieved documents

### Step-by-Step Guide

**Step 1: Prepare Your Documents**
Gather business documents (e.g., product manuals, policy documents, FAQ files). Upload them to your SAP BTP storage or document repository.

**Step 2: Extract Information with SAP Document AI**
Go to "SAP Document AI" service in your subaccount. Upload a sample document (e.g., an invoice or contract). The service will extract key information like:
- Entity names (customer, vendor)
- Amounts and dates
- Document type and classification

**Step 3: Create Embeddings**
Use the Generative AI Hub to create embeddings of your documents. This converts text into numerical vectors that capture semantic meaning.

**Step 4: Build Your Query Interface**
Create a simple interface where users can ask questions. The system will:
1. Convert the question into an embedding
2. Search your document store for similar content
3. Pass relevant documents to the LLM
4. Generate an answer based on your business context

**Step 5: Test Your RAG System**
Ask questions like:
- "What is our return policy for electronics?"
- "Who is the primary contact for vendor ABC?"
- "What are the payment terms in our standard contract?"

The system should retrieve relevant documents and provide accurate answers.

### Code Example (Pseudo-code)
```python
# 1. Retrieve relevant documents
query = "What is our return policy?"
query_embedding = create_embedding(query)
relevant_docs = search_documents(query_embedding, top_k=3)

# 2. Build context for LLM
context = "\n".join([doc.content for doc in relevant_docs])

# 3. Generate answer
prompt = f"Based on this context:\n{context}\n\nAnswer: {query}"
answer = call_llm(prompt, model="gpt-4")

print(answer)
```

### Best Practices
- **Quality Documents**: Ensure your document store is well-organized and up-to-date
- **Relevance Tuning**: Adjust the number of retrieved documents (top_k) based on quality
- **Prompt Engineering**: Craft prompts that clearly instruct the LLM how to use the context
- **Monitoring**: Track query success rates and user feedback to improve the system

### Key Concepts
- **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**: Combining retrieval and generation for context-aware answers
- **Embedding**: A numerical representation of text that captures semantic meaning
- **Vector Search**: Finding similar documents based on embedding similarity
- **Prompt Context**: Providing relevant information to the LLM for better answers

### Next Steps
Learn how to deploy your RAG solution as a production application in Tutorial 4.

- "What's my loyalty points balance?"

**Step 7: Deploy to Production**
Once tested, deploy your agent. It can be accessed via:
- Web chat interface
- Mobile app
- Integration with SAP Fiori apps

### Example Agent Conversation
```
User: "I haven't received my order yet. Order ID: 12345"

Agent: [Calls Retrieve Customer Info and Check Order Status skills]
Agent: "I found your order #12345. It was shipped on Jan 3rd and is currently in transit with FedEx. 
Expected delivery is Jan 6th. You can track it here: [tracking link]. 
Is there anything else I can help with?"

User: "Can I change the delivery address?"

Agent: "Unfortunately, your order is already in transit and cannot be rerouted. 
However, you can refuse delivery and have it returned for reshipping to a different address. 
Would you like me to process that?"
```

### Best Practices
- **Clear Skill Definitions**: Each skill should have a single, well-defined purpose
- **Error Handling**: Design fallbacks for when skills fail
- **User Feedback**: Collect feedback to improve agent responses
- **Regular Updates**: Keep your agent trained on new business processes

### Key Concepts
