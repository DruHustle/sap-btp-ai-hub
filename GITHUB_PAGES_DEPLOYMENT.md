This guide provides step-by-step instructions for deploying the SAP BTP AI Learning Hub website to GitHub Pages for permanent, free hosting.

## 📋 Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:
- A GitHub account ([github.com](https://github.com))
- Git installed on your computer ([git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com))
- Node.js 18+ and pnpm installed
- The project files (either cloned or downloaded)

## 🎯 Deployment Overview

GitHub Pages is a free hosting service that allows you to publish static websites directly from a GitHub repository. The deployment process involves:

1. Creating a GitHub repository
2. Configuring GitHub Pages settings
3. Building the project for production
4. Deploying to GitHub Pages
5. Verifying the live website

## Step-by-Step Deployment Instructions

### Phase 1: GitHub Repository Setup

#### Step 1.1: Create a New GitHub Repository

1. Visit [github.com/new](https://github.com/new)
2. Sign in with your GitHub account (create one if needed)
3. Fill in the repository details:
   - **Repository name**: `sap-btp-ai-hub`
   - **Description**: "Interactive learning platform for SAP BTP AI solutions"
   - **Visibility**: Select **Public** (required for free GitHub Pages)
   - **Initialize repository**: Leave unchecked (you'll push existing code)
4. Click **Create repository**

#### Step 1.2: Copy Your Repository URL

After creating the repository, GitHub displays a URL like:
```
https://github.com/DruHustle/sap-btp-ai-hub.git
```

Copy this URL - you'll need it in the next step.

### Phase 2: Local Project Configuration

#### Step 2.1: Navigate to Your Project Directory

Open a terminal and navigate to your project folder:
```bash
cd sap-btp-ai-hub
```

#### Step 2.2: Initialize Git Repository (if not already done)

If this is a new project without git initialized:
```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit: SAP BTP AI Learning Hub"
```

#### Step 2.3: Add Remote Repository

Connect your local project to the GitHub repository:
```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/DruHustle/sap-btp-ai-hub.git
git branch -M main
```

Replace `DruHustle` with your actual GitHub username.

#### Step 2.4: Update package.json

Add the `homepage` field to your `package.json` file. This tells the build system where your site will be hosted:

```json
{
  "name": "sap-btp-ai-hub",
  "homepage": "https://DruHustle.github.io/sap-btp-ai-hub",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "type": "module",
  ...
}
```

**Important**: Replace `DruHustle` with your actual GitHub username.

#### Step 2.5: Install gh-pages Package

Install the `gh-pages` package to automate GitHub Pages deployment:
```bash
pnpm add -D gh-pages
```

#### Step 2.6: Update package.json Scripts

Add deployment scripts to your `package.json`:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "vite --host",
    "build": "vite build",
    "predeploy": "pnpm build",
    "deploy": "gh-pages -d dist",
    "preview": "vite preview --host",
    "check": "tsc --noEmit",
    "format": "prettier --write ."
  }
}
```

The key additions are:
- `"predeploy"`: Automatically builds the project before deployment
- `"deploy"`: Deploys the built files to GitHub Pages

### Phase 3: Build and Deploy

#### Step 3.1: Build the Project

Create a production-optimized build:
```bash
pnpm build
```

This command:
- Compiles React components
- Optimizes CSS and JavaScript
- Minifies code for faster loading
- Creates the `dist/` folder with all static files

**Expected output**: You should see a `dist/` folder in your project directory.

#### Step 3.2: Deploy to GitHub Pages

Deploy your built project to GitHub Pages:
```bash
pnpm deploy
```

This command:
- Runs the `predeploy` script (builds the project)
- Pushes the contents of the `dist/` folder to the `gh-pages` branch
- GitHub Pages automatically serves the content

**Expected output**: 
```
Published
```

#### Step 3.3: Push Code to Main Branch

Push your project code to the main branch (for version control):
```bash
git push -u origin main
```

### Phase 4: GitHub Pages Configuration

#### Step 4.1: Access Repository Settings

1. Go to your GitHub repository: `https://github.com/DruHustle/sap-btp-ai-hub`
2. Click the **Settings** tab
3. In the left sidebar, click **Pages**

#### Step 4.2: Configure Pages Settings

In the GitHub Pages section:

1. **Source**: Select **Deploy from a branch**
2. **Branch**: Select **gh-pages**
3. **Folder**: Select **/ (root)**
4. Click **Save**

**Note**: The `gh-pages` branch was automatically created when you ran `pnpm deploy`.

#### Step 4.3: Wait for Deployment

GitHub Pages typically deploys within 1-2 minutes. You'll see a message:
```
Your site is published at https://DruHustle.github.io/sap-btp-ai-hub
```

### Phase 5: Verification

#### Step 5.1: Access Your Live Website

1. Copy the URL from the GitHub Pages settings
2. Paste it into your browser
3. Verify that your website loads correctly

**Expected URL format**: `https://DruHustle.github.io/sap-btp-ai-hub`

#### Step 5.2: Test Website Functionality

- Navigate through all pages
- Click buttons and links
- Verify responsive design on mobile devices
- Check that images load correctly

#### Step 5.3: Check Deployment Status

1. Go to your repository
2. Click the **Actions** tab
3. You should see a workflow run for the deployment
4. Verify that it shows a green checkmark (success)

## 🔄 Automated Deployment with GitHub Actions (Optional)

To automatically deploy whenever you push code to the main branch, create a GitHub Actions workflow.

#### Step 1: Create Workflow Directory

```bash
mkdir -p .github/workflows
```

#### Step 2: Create Deployment Workflow File

Create `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`:

```yaml
name: Deploy to GitHub Pages

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v3
      
      - name: Setup pnpm
        uses: pnpm/action-setup@v2
        with:
          version: 10
      
      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: '18'
          cache: 'pnpm'
      
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: pnpm install
      
      - name: Build project
        run: pnpm build
      
      - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
        uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3
        with:
          github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          publish_dir: ./dist
```

#### Step 3: Commit and Push Workflow

```bash
git add .github/workflows/deploy.yml
git commit -m "Add GitHub Actions deployment workflow"
git push origin main
```

#### Step 4: Verify Automation

1. Make a small change to your code
2. Commit and push: `git push origin main`
3. Go to the **Actions** tab in your repository
4. Watch the workflow run automatically
5. After completion, your website updates automatically

## 📝 Post-Deployment Tasks

### Update Your GitHub Profile

Add a link to your website in your GitHub profile:
1. Go to your GitHub profile settings
2. Add the website URL to your profile bio or website field

### Share Your Website

Share your learning hub with others:
- Twitter: `Check out my SAP BTP AI Learning Hub: https://DruHustle.github.io/sap-btp-ai-hub`
- LinkedIn: Post about your new resource
- SAP Community: Share in relevant forums

### Monitor Analytics (Optional)

To track visitor statistics:
1. Install Google Analytics
2. Add your tracking ID to the HTML template
3. Monitor traffic and user engagement

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Website Shows 404 Error

**Cause**: Incorrect homepage URL in `package.json`

**Solution**:
1. Verify the `homepage` field matches your GitHub Pages URL
2. Rebuild: `pnpm build`
3. Redeploy: `pnpm deploy`

### Issue: Assets (Images, CSS) Not Loading

**Cause**: Incorrect asset paths due to subdirectory hosting

**Solution**: The build process should handle this automatically, but verify:
1. Images are in `client/public/images/`
2. CSS is properly imported in components
3. Rebuild and redeploy

### Issue: Deployment Fails

**Cause**: Multiple possible reasons

**Solution**:
1. Check GitHub Actions logs: Go to **Actions** tab and review the failed workflow
2. Verify all dependencies are installed: `pnpm install`
3. Test build locally: `pnpm build`
4. Check for TypeScript errors: `pnpm check`

### Issue: Changes Not Appearing After Deployment

**Cause**: Browser cache or GitHub Pages cache

**Solution**:
1. Hard refresh your browser: `Ctrl+Shift+R` (Windows) or `Cmd+Shift+R` (Mac)
2. Clear browser cache
3. Wait 5 minutes for GitHub Pages to update
4. Try a different browser
